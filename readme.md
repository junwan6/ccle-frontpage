# CCLE Template

## Task

Redesign the CCLE front page in your style, but keep some elements intact.
Read the [UCLA brand guidelines](http://brand.ucla.edu/brand/overview/) and interpret it as you see fit in your design.

This template has been built up with [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) so that you can have create a live working demo of your design (with full html/css/js).  Foundation sets up the basic styles and typography for you.  Feel free to use any of the components/controls/navigation it provides for you.  Make good use of the responsive grid so that your design is mobile friendly.

Look into the [Foundation docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) for reference.

Feel free to go beyond Foundation if you need to do so.  Feel free to use any other framework or library (like jQuery).

## Installation

This project has been set up for you to get started quickly.  To install and run do:

```bash
$ npm install
## If you don't have bower already installed, install bower:
$ npm install -g bower
$ bower install
$ npm start
```

If all that works, you should be able to edit anything under the `src` directory and it will automatically refresh the browser for you.

If something went wrong, you most likely need to install Node (npm is installed as part of node) or something else, some references:

* https://bower.io/#install-bower

* http://gulpjs.com
* https://babeljs.io

The template engine uses [Panini](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/panini.html).
